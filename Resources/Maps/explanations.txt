Each map will be a txt with codes looking like this :

w00 w00 w00 w00 t12 t22 t22 t12 t12
w00 w00 t12 t12 t22 t22 t22 t12 t12 

...

With each code representing a texture of 32 * 32 in the game files
Code can also use letters (so having wA1 for exemple)
theres no limit for maps size, but code only are 2 letters/numbers
Invalid codes will be replaced by the default texture
Some codes will have special use, such as doors unlocking with a special item, but this will be handled by the map generation itself and then in the scene update.
{

    w : Wall
    t : Tile
    a : Water

}

If nothing is given, wall will be used by default


Each map will have a config.txt file containing different informations :
    - Map size (in tiles)
    - Player spawn position (tile !!)

Note that the first tile will always be placed in 0;0 and then go 32 by 32 in different directions based on the map size


Exemple of config :
    - 100 150 0 20 
    -> Map of 100 * 150 tiles (so 32 * 100 pixels wide, if our texture is 32*32 pixels), with the player spawning on the very left of the map, at the 20th tile starting from the top of the map
