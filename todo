URGENT :
    - Make a game (maybe?)

    - Make use of the "step" option in the collision system to save performances
 
    - Add the melee on right click

    - Code the player death (help)

    - Make a cache for the projectiles to gain more fps
        -> Use the "reset" function in projectiles
        -> Instead of deleting at 0 hp, you can hide them !

KINDA IMPORTANT :
    - Remake the FPS counter (directly in window, with a bool to display it or no)
        -> Use the DebugFps() function

    - Fix the visual bug when switching weapon 
        -> This bug is due to the position of the hidden weapon, getting back to the real player angle on the scene (one frame !)

MEH :
    - Make achievements
    - Make a save file
    - Make scopes, weapons, melee, ammo, different ammo for diff weapon
