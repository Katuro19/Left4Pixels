URGENT :
    - Make a game (maybe?)

    - Make that the zombies dont stay stuck near the player dealing no damages

    - Make use of the "step" option in the collision system to save performances

    - Change projectile texture orientation
    
    - Change projectile to add a parameter adding a "random" angle shoot (PIERRE LUC C A TOI DE FAIRE CA) (and fix the bullet not going toward where we aim)
        - The angle already have setter and getter (IN THE WEAPON !!), and is set by the weapon loading.


KINDA IMPORTANT :
    - Remake the FPS counter (directly in window, with a bool to display it or no)
        -> Use the DebugFps() function


MEH :
    - Make achievements
    - Make a save file
    - Make scopes, weapons, melee, ammo, different ammo for diff weapon
